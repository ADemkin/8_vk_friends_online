# Watcher of Friends Online

This script will show all your online friends in VK.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# How to Use

Launch script using terminal. It will ask for login details and will print online friends;

example:
```
python3 vk_friends_online.py
Login: billclinton@gov.us
Password: [password]

George Bush
Donald Trump
Barak Obama
Hrederik Okel
Artemiy Grebennikov

```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
